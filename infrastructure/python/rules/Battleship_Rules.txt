Rules of Battleship:

1. Setup:
   - Each player has a grid (typically 10x10) on which to place their ships.
   - Ships are placed either horizontally or vertically, and cannot overlap or go off the grid.
   - The types of ships and their sizes are:
       - Carrier: 5 spaces
       - Battleship: 4 spaces
       - Cruiser: 3 spaces
       - Submarine: 3 spaces
       - Destroyer: 2 spaces
   - Each player secretly places their ships on their grid.

2. Objective:
   - The goal is to sink all of your opponent's ships before they sink yours.

3. Gameplay:
   - Players take turns calling out a coordinate (e.g., "B5") to attack.
   - The opponent must declare whether the attack is a "hit" or a "miss."
   - If the attack hits a ship, the attacking player continues until they miss or sink a ship.
   - A ship is sunk when all the squares it occupies are hit. The opponent must announce which ship has been sunk.

4. End of Game:
   - The game ends when one player sinks all of the opponent's ships.
   - The player who sinks all the opponent's ships first is declared the winner.

5. Additional Rules:
   - Players cannot change the position of their ships once the game starts.
   - No "peeking" at the opponent's grid.
   - A hit and miss must be marked on each player's tracking grid to keep the game organized.
